**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Story**: 0.1 - Project Scaffolding and Tanstack Start Setup

## Risk Summary

| Category | Level | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | 0 | 0 | No critical risks identified |
| High | 0 | 0 | No high risks identified |
| Medium | 1 | 1 | Testing framework validation gap |
| Low | 2 | 2 | Code cleanup and documentation |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Medium Risk: Testing Framework Validation (RISK-001)
- **Impact**: Medium - Could lead to undetected setup issues in future development
- **Probability**: Medium - Common issue in foundational setup stories
- **Mitigation**: Implement setup validation tests before next story begins
- **Owner**: Development Team

### Low Risk: Demo Code in Production Path (RISK-002)
- **Impact**: Low - Cosmetic issue that could confuse users
- **Probability**: High - Demo routes currently hardcoded
- **Mitigation**: Remove demo routes before production deployment
- **Owner**: Development Team

### Low Risk: Missing Documentation (RISK-003)
- **Impact**: Low - May slow future development and onboarding
- **Probability**: Medium - Common in initial implementation phases
- **Mitigation**: Add component documentation in upcoming stories
- **Owner**: Development Team

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Add basic setup validation tests to verify environment requirements
   - Clean up demo routes from Header component

2. **Future Actions**:
   - Establish component documentation standards
   - Implement automated testing pipeline

## Risk Monitoring

- Review testing coverage in next story QA gate
- Monitor build pipeline reliability as development progresses
- Track documentation coverage during component development
