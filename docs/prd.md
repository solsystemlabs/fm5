# 3D Printing Business Management Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Eliminate file management chaos by providing systematic digital asset organization with searchable metadata
- Automate filament inventory tracking and consumption calculations to prevent stockouts and enable data-driven purchasing  
- Enable intelligent production planning through smart print queue management and sales velocity insights
- Create operational efficiency that frees up 60% of admin time for R&D and market expansion activities
- Support business growth through seasonal inventory planning and market event preparation tools
- Establish foundation for future AI-powered slicer optimization and predictive analytics

### Background Context

The 3D printing business landscape for small-scale operators suffers from operational inefficiencies that limit growth potential. Current workflows rely on manual file management through Windows folders, leading to lost slicer settings, constant re-work, and inability to track inventory or production metrics. This creates a ceiling on business growth and prevents operators from focusing on creative product development and market expansion.

Our target user operates a small 3D printing business with designer partnerships, producing model variants for market events and wholesale distribution. The core problem is systematic: without proper digital asset management and inventory tracking, the business cannot scale beyond manual capacity limits. This PRD addresses these operational bottlenecks through comprehensive automation and intelligence layers.

### Information Architecture
- **Dashboard-Centered**: Primary landing page shows status of queue, inventory alerts, and quick actions
- **Search-Optimized**: Prominent search with intelligent filtering and faceted navigation
- **Context-Aware**: Interface adapts based on user's current workflow stage (planning, printing, inventory management)

### Visual Design Principles  
- **Clean and Functional**: Minimal visual noise with focus on actionable information
- **Status-Driven**: Color coding and badges communicate system state at a glance
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Business tool appearance that inspires confidence and productivity

### Key User Flows
1. **Model Discovery**: Search/browse → Preview → Download sliced file → Queue for printing
2. **Inventory Management**: View current stock → Identify low items → Generate shopping list → Purchase
3. **Production Planning**: Review queue → Check feasibility → Optimize batch printing → Execute
4. **Event Preparation**: Select event theme → Assign products → Verify inventory → Plan production schedule
