## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.5 completion:

- **BetterAuth Production Ready**: Authentication system successfully implemented with JWT tokens, ready for Xata PostgreSQL integration
- **Database Schema Established**: Prisma schema includes all required tables (users, sessions, accounts) with proper relationships for BetterAuth
- **tRPC Infrastructure**: Complete API structure with authentication middleware, ready for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- **Docker Development**: Local development environment fully functional, provides baseline for production parity

### Architecture Decisions

**Deployment Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```
Development (Docker) → Staging (Cloudflare Worker) → Production (Cloudflare Worker)
                    ↓                               ↓
              Local PostgreSQL              Xata PostgreSQL (staging & production)
                    ↓                               ↓
                MinIO                     Cloudflare R2 (staging & production buckets)
```

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Deployment Platform**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless edge deployment)
- **Database**: Xata PostgreSQL with HTTP API (no connection pooling needed)
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with native Workers integration
- **Email Service**: Resend HTTP API integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Wrangler CLI deployment
- **Monitoring**: Cloudflare Analytics with custom health checks

### Infrastructure Components

**Cloudflare Workers Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Staging Worker (`fm5-staging`):**

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "fm5-staging"
main = ".output/server/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[env.staging]
vars = { NODE_ENV = "staging", APP_ENV = "staging" }

[[env.staging.r2_buckets]]
binding = "FILE_STORAGE"
bucket_name = "fm5-staging-files"
```

**Production Worker (`fm5-production`):**

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "fm5-production"
main = ".output/server/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[env.production]
vars = { NODE_ENV = "production", APP_ENV = "production" }

[[env.production.r2_buckets]]
binding = "FILE_STORAGE"
bucket_name = "fm5-production-files"
```

### Database Integration

**Xata Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Connection Strategy:**

- **Development**: Prisma → Local PostgreSQL (existing Docker setup)
- **Staging**: Prisma → Xata HTTP API (`fm5-staging` database)
- **Production**: Prisma → Xata HTTP API (`fm5-production` database)

**Environment Variables Required:**

```bash
# Staging
XATA_API_KEY=<staging-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<staging-xata-database-url>

# Production
XATA_API_KEY=<production-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<production-xata-database-url>
```

**Migration Strategy:**

1. Export existing Prisma schema
2. Import schema to Xata staging database
3. Test application against staging database
4. Import schema to Xata production database
5. Configure environment variables for both environments

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflow** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checking
2. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests
3. **Build**: Tanstack Start production build with Nitro output
4. **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Deploy Staging**: Automatic Wrangler deployment to staging
6. **Deploy Production**: Manual approval and deployment to production

**Workflow File Structure:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # Auto-deploy to staging
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual production deployment

jobs:
  test-and-build: # Quality gates
  deploy-staging: # Automatic staging deployment
  deploy-production: # Manual production deployment
```

### Environment Variable Management

**Required Secrets** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token for Wrangler deployment
- `XATA_STAGING_API_KEY`: Xata API key for staging database
- `XATA_PRODUCTION_API_KEY`: Xata API key for production database

**Wrangler Secrets (per environment):**

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<environment-specific-jwt-secret>
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<environment-specific-auth-secret>

# Database
XATA_API_KEY=<environment-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<environment-xata-database-url>

# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=<environment-resend-api-key>

# File Storage (if needed)
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<environment-r2-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<environment-r2-secret-key>
```

### Integration Points

**BetterAuth Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// lib/auth.ts - Production configuration
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: {
    provider: 'postgres',
    url: process.env.XATA_DATABASE_URL, // Xata HTTP API URL
  },
  session: {
    expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
    updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
  },
  jwt: {
    issuer: 'fm5-app',
    audience: ['fm5-web'],
  },
  plugins: [
    nodejs(), // Required for Cloudflare Workers
  ],
})
```

**R2 File Storage Integration:**

```typescript
// File storage binding available in Workers
interface Env {
  FILE_STORAGE: R2Bucket
}

export async function uploadFile(env: Env, key: string, file: File) {
  await env.FILE_STORAGE.put(key, file.stream(), {
    httpMetadata: { contentType: file.type },
  })
}
```

### File Locations and Project Structure

**New Files to Create** [Source: project structure]:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `wrangler.toml`: Cloudflare Workers configuration (staging/production)
- `src/routes/health.tsx`: Health check endpoint
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Deployment helper scripts (optional)

**Files to Modify** [Source: existing project structure]:

- `lib/auth.ts`: Add production Xata configuration
- `lib/trpc.ts`: Ensure Cloudflare Workers compatibility
- `package.json`: Add Wrangler CLI dependency
- `.env.example`: Add production environment variables template

### Monitoring and Health Checks

**Health Check Endpoint** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// /health endpoint implementation
export async function healthCheck(): Promise<Response> {
  try {
    // Check Xata database connectivity
    const dbCheck = await xata.db.users.getFirst()

    // Check R2 storage connectivity
    const r2Check = await env.FILE_STORAGE.head('health-check')

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        services: {
          database: 'ok',
          storage: 'ok',
        },
      }),
      {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      },
    )
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        status: 'unhealthy',
        error: error.message,
      }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      },
    )
  }
}
```

**Monitoring Configuration:**

- **Cloudflare Analytics**: Request metrics, error rates, performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Health check success rates, database response times
- **Log Aggregation**: Wrangler tail for real-time debugging

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Deployment Testing:**

- **Unit Tests**: All existing tests must pass in CI pipeline
- **Integration Tests**: Database connectivity tests with Xata
- **Health Check Tests**: Automated testing of health endpoints
- **Rollback Tests**: Deployment rollback procedures validation

**Environment Testing:**

- **Staging Validation**: Full application functionality in staging
- **Production Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality after production deployment
- **Cross-Environment**: Ensure parity between staging and production

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures

**Rollback Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Wrangler Commands:**

```bash
# List deployments
wrangler deployments list --name fm5-production

# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --name fm5-production [DEPLOYMENT_ID]

# Emergency rollback
wrangler rollback --name fm5-production --message "Emergency rollback"
```

**Recovery Procedures:**

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Use Wrangler rollback to previous working version
2. **Database Issues**: Verify Xata connectivity and API keys
3. **R2 Issues**: Check bucket permissions and access keys
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify all secrets are properly configured
5. **DNS Issues**: Check custom domain configuration in Cloudflare
