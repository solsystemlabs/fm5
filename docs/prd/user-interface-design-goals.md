# User Interface Design Goals

## Design Philosophy
- **Workflow-Centric**: Interface prioritizes common task flows over comprehensive feature access
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features available but not prominently displayed for casual users  
- **Visual-First**: Thumbnail images and visual cues reduce cognitive load for model identification
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Essential functions accessible during printing operations via phone/tablet

## Information Architecture
- **Dashboard-Centered**: Primary landing page shows status of queue, inventory alerts, and quick actions
- **Search-Optimized**: Prominent search with intelligent filtering and faceted navigation
- **Context-Aware**: Interface adapts based on user's current workflow stage (planning, printing, inventory management)

## Visual Design Principles  
- **Clean and Functional**: Minimal visual noise with focus on actionable information
- **Status-Driven**: Color coding and badges communicate system state at a glance
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Business tool appearance that inspires confidence and productivity

## Key User Flows
1. **Model Discovery**: Search/browse → Preview → Download sliced file → Queue for printing
2. **Inventory Management**: View current stock → Identify low items → Generate shopping list → Purchase
3. **Production Planning**: Review queue → Check feasibility → Optimize batch printing → Execute
4. **Event Preparation**: Select event theme → Assign products → Verify inventory → Plan production schedule
