## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 0.2 successfully implemented the Docker PostgreSQL 18rc1 environment with uuid-ossp and pg_stat_statements extensions already installed. The database is accessible at localhost:5432 with user `printmgmt_user` and database `printmgmt_dev`. Database extensions and user permissions are properly configured.

### Architecture Context

[Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md#database-schema]

**Database Schema Requirements:**

The complete database schema implements user-isolated multi-tenancy with Row Level Security (RLS) for complete data separation between users. All business entities are scoped to individual users for privacy and security.

**Core Entity Structure:**

- **Users Table**: Authentication and business profile information
- **Models Table**: Base 3D designs with designer attribution (user-isolated)
- **Model Variants Table**: Specific configurations with slicer settings and JSONB metadata (user-isolated)
- **Filaments Table**: Material specifications separate from inventory (user-isolated)
- **Filament Inventory Table**: Physical spool tracking with batch information (user-isolated)
- **Filament Requirements Table**: Links variants to required filaments with usage data
- **Print Jobs Table**: Queue management and production tracking (user-isolated)

**Key Relationships:**

- User (1:N) Models - user owns multiple models
- User (1:N) FilamentInventory - user-specific inventory tracking
- Model (1:N) ModelVariant - hierarchical organization
- ModelVariant (M:N) FilamentInventory - material requirements mapping
- PrintJob (M:1) ModelVariant - production queue relationships

**Technical Constraints:**

[Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md#database-schema]

- **PostgreSQL Version**: 18 Beta (already implemented in Story 0.2)
- **Row Level Security**: Complete user data isolation via RLS policies
- **JSONB Fields**: bambu_metadata field stores complete Bambu Studio configuration (600+ parameters)
- **Full-Text Search**: GIN indexes on model names and descriptions for <2 second search performance
- **Automatic Triggers**: updated_at timestamps and filament demand counting

**Prisma Configuration Requirements:**

- **Version**: PrismaORM 5.0+ for latest TypeScript integration
- **Generator**: Prisma Client with TypeScript output
- **Connection**: PostgreSQL connection string from .env file
- **Migration Strategy**: Incremental migrations with rollback capability

**Performance Requirements:**

[Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md#performance-indexes]

Critical indexes for operational performance:

- GIN indexes for full-text search (models table)
- JSONB indexes for metadata search (model_variants table)
- User isolation indexes for all user-scoped queries
- Queue ordering indexes (status, priority, created_at)
- Inventory tracking indexes (quantity_grams, low_stock_threshold)

**Security Requirements:**

[Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md#row-level-security]

- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all user-scoped tables
- **User Isolation Policies**: Complete data separation via user_id checks
- **Authentication Integration**: current_user_id() function returns authenticated user ID
- **Secure Defaults**: All policies default to deny access without proper user context

### File Locations

**New files to be created:**

- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete Prisma schema definition
- `/prisma/migrations/` - Directory for migration files
- `/lib/db.ts` - Prisma client configuration and connection
- `/lib/schemas.ts` - Zod schema definitions matching Prisma models
- `/.env` updates - Database connection string for Prisma

**Integration Points:**

- Database connection uses existing Docker PostgreSQL from Story 0.2
- Schema integrates with Zod definitions for end-to-end type safety
- Migration strategy supports future schema evolution requirements

### Testing

Testing requirements for database schema implementation:

- **Schema Validation**: Verify all tables and relationships are created correctly
- **Index Performance**: Test query performance with indexes
- **RLS Policy Testing**: Verify complete user data isolation
- **Trigger Functionality**: Test automatic timestamp and demand count updates
- **Migration Testing**: Verify migration can be applied and rolled back safely
- **Data Integrity**: Test foreign key constraints and validation rules
