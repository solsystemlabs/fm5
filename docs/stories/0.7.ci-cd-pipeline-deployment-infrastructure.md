## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.5 completion:

- **BetterAuth Production Ready**: Authentication system successfully implemented with JWT tokens, ready for Xata PostgreSQL integration
- **Database Schema Established**: Prisma schema includes all required tables (users, sessions, accounts) with proper relationships for BetterAuth
- **tRPC Infrastructure**: Complete API structure with authentication middleware, ready for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- **Docker Development**: Local development environment fully functional, provides baseline for production parity

### Architecture Decisions

**Deployment Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```
Development (Docker) → Staging (Cloudflare Worker) → Production (Cloudflare Worker)
                    ↓                               ↓
              Local PostgreSQL              Xata PostgreSQL (staging & production)
                    ↓                               ↓
                MinIO                     Cloudflare R2 (staging & production buckets)
```

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Deployment Platform**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless edge deployment)
- **Database**: Xata PostgreSQL with HTTP API (no connection pooling needed)
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with native Workers integration
- **Email Service**: Resend HTTP API integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Wrangler CLI deployment
- **Monitoring**: Cloudflare Analytics with custom health checks

### Infrastructure Components

**Cloudflare Workers Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Staging Worker (`fm5-staging`):**

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "fm5-staging"
main = ".output/server/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[env.staging]
vars = { NODE_ENV = "staging", APP_ENV = "staging" }

[[env.staging.r2_buckets]]
binding = "FILE_STORAGE"
bucket_name = "fm5-staging-files"
```

**Production Worker (`fm5-production`):**

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "fm5-production"
main = ".output/server/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[env.production]
vars = { NODE_ENV = "production", APP_ENV = "production" }

[[env.production.r2_buckets]]
binding = "FILE_STORAGE"
bucket_name = "fm5-production-files"
```

### Database Integration

**Xata Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Connection Strategy:**

- **Development**: Prisma → Local PostgreSQL (existing Docker setup)
- **Staging**: Prisma → Xata HTTP API (`fm5-staging` database)
- **Production**: Prisma → Xata HTTP API (`fm5-production` database)

**Environment Variables Required:**

```bash
# Staging
XATA_API_KEY=<staging-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<staging-xata-database-url>

# Production
XATA_API_KEY=<production-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<production-xata-database-url>
```

**Migration Strategy:**

1. Export existing Prisma schema
2. Import schema to Xata staging database
3. Test application against staging database
4. Import schema to Xata production database
5. Configure environment variables for both environments

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflows** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Multiple Workflow Strategy:**

FM5 uses three separate workflows following industry best practices:

1. **PR Checks Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`) - Runs on all pull requests
   - Parallelized quality checks: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, tests
   - Fast feedback loop for developers
   - Blocks merge if checks fail

2. **Staging Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) - Runs on master merge
   - Builds production bundle
   - Deploys to Cloudflare Workers staging environment
   - Runs integration tests against staging

3. **Production Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`) - Manual trigger
   - Requires manual approval
   - Deploys to Cloudflare Workers production environment
   - Includes rollback procedures

**Workflow Architecture Benefits:**

- **Parallelization**: Quality checks run simultaneously for faster feedback
- **Separation of Concerns**: PR validation separate from deployment
- **Performance**: Faster CI/CD cycle through parallel execution
- **Clarity**: Each workflow has single, clear responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual workflows

**Workflow File Structure:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: PR Quality Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [ESLint checks]

  typecheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [TypeScript checking]

  format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Prettier validation]

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Unit and integration tests]

# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Build, deploy to staging, integration tests]

# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps: [Build, deploy to production, smoke tests]
```

### Environment Variable Management

**Required Secrets** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token for Wrangler deployment
- `XATA_STAGING_API_KEY`: Xata API key for staging database
- `XATA_PRODUCTION_API_KEY`: Xata API key for production database

**Wrangler Secrets (per environment):**

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<environment-specific-jwt-secret>
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<environment-specific-auth-secret>

# Database
XATA_API_KEY=<environment-xata-api-key>
XATA_DATABASE_URL=<environment-xata-database-url>

# Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=<environment-resend-api-key>

# File Storage (if needed)
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<environment-r2-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<environment-r2-secret-key>
```

### Integration Points

**BetterAuth Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// lib/auth.ts - Production configuration
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: {
    provider: 'postgres',
    url: process.env.XATA_DATABASE_URL, // Xata HTTP API URL
  },
  session: {
    expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
    updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
  },
  jwt: {
    issuer: 'fm5-app',
    audience: ['fm5-web'],
  },
  plugins: [
    nodejs(), // Required for Cloudflare Workers
  ],
})
```

**R2 File Storage Integration:**

```typescript
// File storage binding available in Workers
interface Env {
  FILE_STORAGE: R2Bucket
}

export async function uploadFile(env: Env, key: string, file: File) {
  await env.FILE_STORAGE.put(key, file.stream(), {
    httpMetadata: { contentType: file.type },
  })
}
```

### File Locations and Project Structure

**New Files to Create** [Source: project structure]:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `wrangler.toml`: Cloudflare Workers configuration (staging/production)
- `src/routes/health.tsx`: Health check endpoint
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Deployment helper scripts (optional)

**Files to Modify** [Source: existing project structure]:

- `lib/auth.ts`: Add production Xata configuration
- `lib/trpc.ts`: Ensure Cloudflare Workers compatibility
- `package.json`: Add Wrangler CLI dependency
- `.env.example`: Add production environment variables template

### Monitoring and Health Checks

**Health Check Endpoint** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// /health endpoint implementation
export async function healthCheck(): Promise<Response> {
  try {
    // Check Xata database connectivity
    const dbCheck = await xata.db.users.getFirst()

    // Check R2 storage connectivity
    const r2Check = await env.FILE_STORAGE.head('health-check')

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        services: {
          database: 'ok',
          storage: 'ok',
        },
      }),
      {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      },
    )
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        status: 'unhealthy',
        error: error.message,
      }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      },
    )
  }
}
```

**Monitoring Configuration:**

- **Cloudflare Analytics**: Request metrics, error rates, performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Health check success rates, database response times
- **Log Aggregation**: Wrangler tail for real-time debugging

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Deployment Testing:**

- **Unit Tests**: All existing tests must pass in CI pipeline
- **Integration Tests**: Database connectivity tests with Xata
- **Health Check Tests**: Automated testing of health endpoints
- **Rollback Tests**: Deployment rollback procedures validation

**Environment Testing:**

- **Staging Validation**: Full application functionality in staging
- **Production Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality after production deployment
- **Cross-Environment**: Ensure parity between staging and production

### Rollback and Recovery Procedures

**Rollback Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Wrangler Commands:**

```bash
# List deployments
wrangler deployments list --name fm5-production

# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback --name fm5-production [DEPLOYMENT_ID]

# Emergency rollback
wrangler rollback --name fm5-production --message "Emergency rollback"
```

**Recovery Procedures:**

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Use Wrangler rollback to previous working version
2. **Database Issues**: Verify Xata connectivity and API keys
3. **R2 Issues**: Check bucket permissions and access keys
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify all secrets are properly configured
5. **DNS Issues**: Check custom domain configuration in Cloudflare

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**

All CI/CD infrastructure was successfully implemented with the following key accomplishments:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Created three separate workflows for better separation of concerns and parallelization:
   - `pr-checks.yml`: Parallelized quality checks (lint, typecheck, format, test, security)
   - `deploy-staging.yml`: Automated staging deployment on master merge
   - `deploy-production.yml`: Manual production deployment with "DEPLOY" confirmation

2. **Existing Infrastructure Validated**: Confirmed all existing infrastructure was production-ready:
   - Wrangler configuration with staging/production environments
   - Health check endpoints with comprehensive service monitoring
   - Secrets management scripts for environment variable handling
   - R2 bucket bindings configured for both environments

3. **Documentation Created**:
   - `docs/deployment/rollback-procedures.md`: Comprehensive rollback and recovery procedures
   - `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md`: Complete deployment guide with troubleshooting

4. **Testing Validation**:
   - All 117 tests pass (8 skipped)
   - Build completes successfully (2.58 MB total, 710 kB gzipped)
   - ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier checks pass
   - Production bundle ready for deployment

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

- **Separate Workflows**: Following best practices, split monolithic deploy.yml into three focused workflows for better parallelization and faster feedback
- **Confirmation Gate**: Production deployments require typing "DEPLOY" to prevent accidental deployments
- **Comprehensive Health Checks**: Health endpoint monitors database, storage, and email services with detailed status reporting
- **Version Tagging**: Production deployments automatically create git tags for rollback reference

**Infrastructure Status:**

All acceptance criteria met. The infrastructure is production-ready pending:
- GitHub repository secrets configuration (documented in deployment guide)
- Cloudflare Workers custom domain configuration
- Xata database provisioning for staging/production
