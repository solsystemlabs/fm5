# Post-MVP Features (Deferred)

## Epic 5: Advanced Intelligence and Optimization

**Epic Goal**: Establish foundation for learning algorithms that optimize printing success through version tracking and failure analysis.

**Status**: POST-MVP - Deferred until after core business value delivery

**Dependencies**: Requires Epic 4 completion for production data and analytics foundation.

**Story 5.1: ModelVariant Versioning System**
As a 3D printing business owner,
I want to track different versions of my model variants with success/failure rates,
so that I can identify optimal slicer settings over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Version creation allows uploading updated sliced files with change documentation
2. Success/failure tracking provides statistical analysis of variant performance
3. Setting comparisons highlight differences between versions
4. Performance trends guide future slicer parameter decisions
5. Best practice recommendations emerge from successful version patterns

**Dependencies**: Requires Epic 2 metadata extraction and Epic 4 print tracking completion.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Version tracking extends ModelVariant schema with version field
- Success/failure data collected from Epic 3 print queue status updates
- Metadata comparison uses BambuMetadata schema difference analysis
- Statistical analysis uses PostgreSQL analytics functions
- Performance recommendations generated from success pattern analysis

**Story 5.2: Manufacturing Cost Analysis**
As a 3D printing business owner,
I want accurate manufacturing cost calculations for each variant,
so that I can price products appropriately and identify profit opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Cost calculations include filament usage, electricity, and depreciation estimates
2. Batch production costs enable volume pricing strategies
3. Profit margin analysis guides product portfolio decisions
4. Cost tracking over time identifies efficiency improvements
5. Competitive cost analysis supports market positioning

**Dependencies**: Requires Epic 3 inventory cost tracking and Epic 4 production analytics.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Cost calculations use filament usage from BambuMetadata and inventory costs
- Manufacturing cost analysis integrates with Epic 2 consumption tracking
- Cost data stored in costToProduceUsd field per architecture
- Batch cost calculations use Epic 3 production optimization data
- Cost tracking analysis uses time series data from production history
