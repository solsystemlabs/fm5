# Story 0.1: Project Scaffolding and Tanstack Start Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the Tanstack Start project with proper TypeScript configuration,
**so that** development can proceed with the specified tech stack and folder structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tanstack Start project created with TypeScript 5.0+ configuration
2. Folder structure follows frontend specification: app/routes/, components/, lib/, hooks/, types/
3. Package.json configured with all dependencies from tech stack: Tanstack ecosystem, React Aria, TailwindCSS
4. Node.js 20+ environment verified and documented
5. Initial routing structure created with __root.tsx and index.tsx

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#tech-stack-decisions]

**Core Technologies to Install:**
- **Framework**: Tanstack Start (Latest) - Full-stack React framework with excellent DX
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ - Required for Tanstack Start
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ - Type safety across entire stack
- **Database ORM**: PrismaORM 5.0+ - Type-safe database access with great DX
- **State Management**: Tanstack Query v5 - Server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: Tanstack Form (Latest) - Type-safe form validation and handling
- **UI Components**: React Aria (Latest) - Accessibility-first component primitives
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.4+ - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Type Safety**: ArkType + tRPC (Latest) - End-to-end type safety with runtime validation
- **Client Database**: Tanstack DB (Latest) - Reactive client-side database with live queries

**Tanstack Ecosystem Rationale:**
[Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#technology-rationale]
- **Unified TypeScript Experience**: End-to-end type safety from database to UI
- **Excellent Developer Experience**: Hot reload, type checking, integrated tools
- **Performance Optimized**: Built-in caching, optimistic updates, background sync
- **Future-Proof**: Modern React patterns with server components support

```

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Development Environment Requirements:**
- Node.js 20+ for Tanstack Start support
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Hot reload and development server functional
- Git repository with proper .gitignore (node_modules, dist, .env)

### File Locations
**New files to be created:**
- `/package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- `/app/routes/__root.tsx` - Root layout component
- `/app/routes/index.tsx` - Dashboard/home page component
- `/components/ui/index.ts` - UI component exports
- `/lib/utils.ts` - General utility functions
- `/.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
- `/README.md` - Project setup and development instructions

### Testing Standards
No specific testing requirements for this story as it's foundational setup. Future stories will implement testing frameworks as specified in architecture.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#core-architectural-principles]
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript from database to UI components
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality must work without JavaScript
- **Development Experience**: Hot reload, type checking, integrated tools must function
- **Future Compatibility**: Setup must support server components and modern React patterns
