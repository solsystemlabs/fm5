# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Digital Asset Management**

- FR1: System shall store and organize 3D model files (.3mf, .stl) with hierarchical Model â†’ ModelVariant structure
- FR2: System shall extract and store metadata from .gcode/.3mf archives including all slicer parameters (600+ fields)
- FR3: System shall provide search functionality across models and variants using keywords, visual browsing, and filters
- FR4: System shall support model variant versioning to track iterative improvements and slicer setting changes
- FR5: System shall store and display model images for visual identification and browsing
- FR6: System shall integrate with Cloudflare R2 for scalable file storage with direct download capabilities

**Inventory Management**

- FR7: System shall track filament inventory using hex color codes, brand names, and material types for precise matching
- FR8: System shall automatically match sliced file filament metadata to inventory items for consumption tracking
- FR9: System shall calculate filament consumption automatically when print jobs are marked complete
- FR10: System shall support partial consumption tracking for failed prints using completion percentage estimates
- FR11: System shall track physical product inventory including finished prints, keychains, earrings, and accessories
- FR12: System shall generate automated shopping lists based on inventory thresholds with stored purchase URLs

**Production Management**

- FR13: System shall provide print queue management with job status tracking (queued, printing, completed, failed)
- FR14: System shall enable print feasibility checking based on current filament inventory levels
- FR15: System shall track and display sales velocity metrics to identify high-performing variants
- FR16: System shall provide restock recommendations based on inventory levels and sales patterns
- FR17: System shall support market event planning with themed inventory assignment and preparation tracking

**Advanced Features**

- FR18: System shall track print success/failure rates by ModelVariant version for optimization insights
- FR19: System shall calculate manufacturing costs based on filament usage and material costs
- FR20: System shall support seasonal inventory planning with event-specific product recommendations

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**

- NFR1: File upload and metadata extraction shall complete within 30 seconds for files up to 100MB
- NFR2: Search operations shall return results within 2 seconds for libraries up to 1000 variants
- NFR3: System shall support concurrent file operations without performance degradation

**Scalability**

- NFR4: System architecture shall support growth to 10,000+ model variants without redesign
- NFR5: Cloudflare R2 integration shall handle petabyte-scale storage requirements cost-effectively
- NFR6: Database design shall support complex queries across relational data without performance bottlenecks

**Usability**

- NFR7: User interface shall be intuitive for users familiar with 3D printing workflows but new to inventory management
- NFR8: Mobile responsiveness shall enable inventory updates and queue management during printing operations
- NFR9: System shall minimize manual data entry through automated metadata extraction and intelligent defaults

**Reliability**

- NFR10: Metadata extraction shall maintain 99% accuracy across major slicer formats (Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, Cura)
- NFR11: File operations shall include integrity verification and automatic error recovery
- NFR12: Data backup and recovery procedures shall prevent loss of business-critical information
