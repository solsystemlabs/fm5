nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent security implementation:
      - Path traversal protection with sanitization
      - User isolation enforced in file paths
      - File validation (size, type, ownership)
      - Environment gating for dev routes
      - API key protection with graceful fallback
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Well-optimized implementation:
      - Parallel health checks via Promise.all()
      - Streaming support for large files
      - 5-second timeouts prevent hanging
      - Lazy imports avoid client bundle bloat
      - Tests complete in 9.05s (117 tests)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Robust error handling and resilience:
      - Graceful degradation when services unavailable
      - Proper error handling with TRPCError
      - Health check system monitors all services
      - Integration tests validate end-to-end flows
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent code organization and documentation:
      - Clean adapter pattern for storage abstraction
      - Comprehensive inline documentation
      - Consistent naming conventions
      - Proper TypeScript types throughout
      - Well-structured test organization

# Architecture Validation
architecture:
  patterns_used:
    - 'Adapter Pattern (storage abstraction)'
    - 'Strategy Pattern (email adapter selection)'
    - 'Factory Pattern (createStorageAdapter, createEmailAdapter)'

  design_principles:
    - 'Single Responsibility: Each service has focused responsibility'
    - 'Open/Closed: Adapters allow extension without modification'
    - 'Dependency Inversion: Code depends on interfaces, not concrete implementations'
    - 'Interface Segregation: Clean, minimal adapter interfaces'
