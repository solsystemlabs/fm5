# Story 0.7: External Service Integration Planning

## Status

Approved for development

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** external service dependencies configured and ready,
**so that** features requiring third-party services work reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Cloudflare R2 account setup with API keys and bucket configuration
2. Resend email service configured with API keys and email templates
3. Service monitoring and health checks configured for R2 and email services

### External Service Architecture

**Service Integration Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```
Development Environment → Staging Environment → Production Environment
       ↓                         ↓                      ↓
   MinIO (R2 Sim)         Cloudflare R2 Staging   Cloudflare R2 Production
   Local SMTP             Resend Staging          Resend Production
   Local CDN              Cloudflare CDN Test     Cloudflare CDN Live
```

**Cloudflare R2 Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Purpose**: File storage for 3D models, sliced files, and generated content
- **Free Tier**: 10GB storage, 1M Class A operations/month
- **Integration**: Native Cloudflare Workers integration via R2Bucket binding
- **Buckets**: Separate staging (`fm5-staging-files`) and production (`fm5-production-files`) buckets for isolation
- **Security**: User-specific file paths (/users/{userId}/models/{modelId}/) with signed URLs

**Resend Email Service Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Purpose**: Transactional email delivery (user verification, notifications)
- **Free Tier**: 3k emails/month, 100 emails/day
- **Integration**: HTTP API compatible with Cloudflare Workers
- **Features**: Email templates, bounce/complaint handling, analytics
- **Template Structure**: Welcome emails, verification emails, system notifications

### API Integration Patterns

**R2 Storage Integration Pattern** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// File storage binding available in Workers
interface Env {
  FILE_STORAGE: R2Bucket
}

export async function uploadFile(env: Env, key: string, file: File) {
  await env.FILE_STORAGE.put(key, file.stream(), {
    httpMetadata: { contentType: file.type },
  })
}

// Signed URL generation for secure file access
export async function generateSignedUrl(
  env: Env,
  key: string,
  expiresIn: number = 3600, // 1 hour default
): Promise<string> {
  const url = await env.FILE_STORAGE.createSignedUrl(key, {
    expiresIn,
  })
  return url
}
```

**Security Pattern:**

- Signed URLs expire after specified duration (default 1 hour)
- User-specific file paths: `/users/{userId}/models/{modelId}/file.stl`
- Authorization checks verify user owns requested files before generating signed URLs

**Resend Email Integration Pattern** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

```typescript
// lib/email.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend'

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

export async function sendVerificationEmail(
  email: string,
  token: string,
): Promise<void> {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'noreply@fm5.app',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Verify your FM5 account',
    html: `<p>Click <a href="https://app.fm5.com/verify?token=${token}">here</a> to verify your account.</p>`,
  })
}
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

**Required Environment Variables** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Staging Environment:**

```bash
# R2 Configuration
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=<cloudflare-account-id>
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<staging-r2-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<staging-r2-secret-key>

# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=<staging-resend-api-key>

# Domain Configuration
APP_DOMAIN=staging.fm5.app
API_DOMAIN=api-staging.fm5.app
```

**Production Environment:**

```bash
# R2 Configuration
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=<cloudflare-account-id>
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<production-r2-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<production-r2-secret-key>

# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=<production-resend-api-key>

# Domain Configuration
APP_DOMAIN=app.fm5.com
API_DOMAIN=api.fm5.com
```

### Security and Access Control

**File Security Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Upload Validation**: File type and size restrictions
- **Access Control**: Signed URLs for secure file access
- **User Isolation**: File paths include user ID for isolation (/users/{userId}/)
- **Bucket Policies**: Configured for secure file access with staging/production separation

**Email Security Configuration**:

- **API Key Security**: Separate keys for staging and production environments
- **Template Security**: HTML template sanitization and validation

**Email Template Sanitization:**

- Use DOMPurify library or similar for HTML sanitization
- Whitelist allowed HTML tags: `<p>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<h1-h6>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- Strip all `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and event handlers (`onclick`, etc.)
- Validate all email addresses and template variables before rendering

### Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

**Service Monitoring Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **Cloudflare Analytics**: Request metrics, performance monitoring
- **Resend Analytics**: Email delivery and engagement metrics
- **Cost Monitoring**: Usage tracking for Cloudflare services and Resend
- **Health Checks**: Automated service availability monitoring

**Alerting Rules**:

- **Error Rate Alerts**: >5% error rate triggers notification
- **Performance Alerts**: >1000ms P95 response time alerts
- **Email Delivery**: Bounce rate or delivery failure alerts
- **Cost Alerts**: Usage threshold notifications

### Frontend Architecture

**Routes to Create** [Source: TanStack Router file-based routing]:

- `src/routes/dev/services.tsx`: Service testing interface with tabs for R2/Email/CDN testing
- `src/routes/dev/health.tsx`: Environment health dashboard showing staging vs production status

**IMPORTANT - Purpose and Environment Gating:**

**Purpose**: These testing interfaces validate that backend service implementations (R2, Email, CDN) work correctly via the frontend BEFORE building production features. This catches integration issues during development, not after features are built.

**Environment Gating**: `/dev/*` routes MUST only be accessible in development and staging environments, never in production.

Implementation requirement:

```typescript
// In dev route files, add environment check
if (import.meta.env.PROD && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  throw new Error('Dev tools not available in production')
}
```

Alternative pattern: Use route-level middleware to block `/dev/*` routes in production environment.

**React Components to Create** [Source: component architecture]:

- `src/components/dev/R2Tester.tsx`: File upload/download testing UI with progress indicators
- `src/components/dev/EmailTester.tsx`: Email send testing UI with template preview
- `src/components/dev/ServiceStatusCard.tsx`: Individual service status display with color-coded indicators
- `src/components/dev/HealthDashboard.tsx`: Dashboard container component with real-time status
- `src/components/dev/EnvironmentComparison.tsx`: Side-by-side staging vs production comparison

**tRPC Procedures to Create** [Source: tRPC router patterns]:

In `lib/routers/dev.ts` (new router):

```typescript
// Service testing procedures
dev.testR2Upload(file: File) → { success: boolean, url: string, key: string }
dev.testR2Download(key: string) → { success: boolean, signedUrl: string }
dev.testEmailSend(to: string, template: string) → { success: boolean, messageId: string }

// Health monitoring procedures
dev.getServiceHealth() → {
  database: ServiceStatus,
  r2Storage: ServiceStatus,
  email: ServiceStatus
}
dev.getEnvironmentStatus() → {
  staging: EnvironmentHealth,
  production: EnvironmentHealth
}

// Type definitions
type ServiceStatus = {
  status: "ok" | "degraded" | "down",
  responseTime?: number,
  lastChecked: string
}

type EnvironmentHealth = {
  environment: string,
  services: Record<string, ServiceStatus>,
  overallStatus: "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy"
}
```

**Custom React Hooks to Create** [Source: existing hook patterns]:

- `src/hooks/useServiceHealth.ts`: Polls service health every 30s, returns real-time status with auto-refresh
- `src/hooks/useServiceTester.ts`: Handles test execution with loading/error/success states

**UI Design Pattern** [Source: existing component patterns]:

- **Layout**: Card-based layout for each service tester, grid layout for health dashboard
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges (green=healthy, yellow=degraded, red=down)
- **Progress**: File upload progress bars with percentage and size indicators
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for test results (success/error feedback)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly card stacking, desktop grid layout

### File Locations and Project Structure

**New Files to Create** [Source: existing project structure]:

**Backend Infrastructure:**

- `lib/r2-storage.ts`: R2 bucket integration utilities
- `lib/email-service.ts`: Resend email service integration
- `lib/cdn-config.ts`: CDN configuration utilities
- `lib/routers/dev.ts`: Developer tools tRPC router
- `src/routes/api/health.ts`: Health check API endpoint returning JSON status

**Frontend Routes:**

- `src/routes/dev/services.tsx`: Developer service testing interface
- `src/routes/dev/health.tsx`: Environment health dashboard

**Frontend Components:**

- `src/components/dev/R2Tester.tsx`: R2 file testing UI
- `src/components/dev/EmailTester.tsx`: Email testing UI
- `src/components/dev/ServiceStatusCard.tsx`: Service status display
- `src/components/dev/HealthDashboard.tsx`: Health dashboard container
- `src/components/dev/EnvironmentComparison.tsx`: Environment comparison view

**Frontend Hooks:**

- `src/hooks/useServiceHealth.ts`: Service health polling hook
- `src/hooks/useServiceTester.ts`: Service testing hook

**Scripts and Documentation:**

- `scripts/setup-external-services.sh`: External service setup automation
- `docs/external-services-setup.md`: Service configuration documentation

**Files to Modify** [Source: existing project structure]:

- `wrangler.toml`: Add R2 bucket bindings for staging and production
- `.env.example`: Add external service environment variables template
- `lib/auth.ts`: Integrate email verification with Resend

**Health Endpoint Response Format** [Source: architectural requirements]:

```typescript
// src/routes/api/health.ts response structure
{
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
  timestamp: string,
  environment: "development" | "staging" | "production",
  services: {
    database: { status: "ok" | "degraded" | "down", responseTime: number },
    r2Storage: { status: "ok" | "degraded" | "down", responseTime: number },
    email: { status: "ok" | "degraded" | "down" }
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

- **Monitoring tools**: Poll `/api/health` for automated health checks
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Verify deployment health via API endpoint
- **Dashboard**: Frontend loads health data from API endpoint

### Cost and Usage Management

**Service Cost Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

- **R2 Storage**: $0.015/GB/month, free tier: 10GB
- **Resend**: $20/month for 100k emails (after free tier)
- **Cloudflare Workers**: $5/10M requests (very cost effective)
- **Usage Tracking**: Monthly cost reports via Cloudflare dashboard

**Scaling Considerations**:

- **Storage**: R2 scales automatically, pay per GB stored
- **Email**: Resend scales based on volume, predictable pricing
- **CDN**: Included with Cloudflare Workers, global edge performance

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations** [Source: existing patterns]:

- **Service Integration Tests**: `src/__tests__/external-services-*.test.ts`
- **R2 Storage Tests**: `src/__tests__/r2-storage.test.ts`
- **Email Service Tests**: `src/__tests__/email-service.test.ts`
- **Health Check Tests**: `src/__tests__/health-check-external.test.ts`

**Testing Framework** [Source: existing setup]:

- **Test Runner**: Vitest with existing configuration
- **Environment**: Test against staging services with mock fallbacks
- **Coverage**: Service connectivity, configuration validation, error handling

**Mock Implementation Strategy:**

**For Unit Tests (no real external services):**

```typescript
// src/__tests__/mocks/r2-mock.ts - In-memory R2 storage simulation
export const mockR2Bucket = {
  storage: new Map<string, any>(),

  put: vi.fn(async (key: string, value: any, options?: any) => {
    mockR2Bucket.storage.set(key, { value, options })
    return { key }
  }),

  get: vi.fn(async (key: string) => {
    const item = mockR2Bucket.storage.get(key)
    return item
      ? { body: item.value, httpMetadata: item.options?.httpMetadata }
      : null
  }),

  head: vi.fn(async (key: string) => {
    return mockR2Bucket.storage.has(key) ? { key } : null
  }),

  delete: vi.fn(async (key: string) => {
    mockR2Bucket.storage.delete(key)
  }),
}

// src/__tests__/mocks/email-mock.ts - Console logging email mock
export const mockResend = {
  emails: {
    send: vi.fn(async (emailData: any) => {
      console.log('[MOCK EMAIL]', emailData)
      return {
        id: `mock-email-${Date.now()}`,
        from: emailData.from,
        to: emailData.to,
      }
    }),
  },
}

// src/__tests__/mocks/health-mock.ts - Static healthy responses
export const mockHealthResponse = {
  status: 'healthy',
  services: {
    database: { status: 'ok', responseTime: 45 },
    r2Storage: { status: 'ok', responseTime: 120 },
    email: { status: 'ok' },
  },
}
```

**For Integration Tests:**

- Use actual staging services with test credentials
- Clean up test data after each test run (delete uploaded files, etc.)
- Use test-specific prefixes for uploaded files: `/test-data/${testRunId}/...`

**Specific Testing Requirements:**

- **R2 Integration Testing**: Bucket connectivity, upload/download functionality, signed URL generation
- **Email Service Testing**: Template rendering, delivery confirmation (use staging API)
- **Health Check Testing**: Service availability monitoring, status indicators
- **Configuration Testing**: Environment variable validation, service initialization
