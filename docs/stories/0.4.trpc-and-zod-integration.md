## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.3 completion:

- Zod schemas already exist in `/lib/schemas.ts` matching Prisma models
- Database connection established via `/lib/db.ts` with proper Prisma client setup
- User isolation implemented via Row Level Security policies in database
- All required entities and relationships are available for tRPC integration

### Data Models

**Existing Zod Schemas** [Source: Story 0.3 completion notes]:

- UserSchema, ModelSchema, ModelVariantSchema available in `/lib/schemas.ts`
- FilamentSchema, FilamentInventorySchema, PrintJobSchema defined
- All schemas match Prisma models exactly for 1:1 type mapping
- Schemas include proper validation rules and relationships

**Database Context** [Source: Story 0.3 completion notes]:

- PostgreSQL 18 connection via Prisma client in `/lib/db.ts`
- Row Level Security ensures user data isolation automatically
- GIN indexes for full-text search performance (<2 second requirement)
- Triggers for updated_at timestamps and filament demand counting

### API Specifications

**Router Structure** [Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md]:

- Authentication router: `/auth` with me, updateProfile procedures
- Models router: `/models` with list, create, update, delete procedures
- Variants router: `/variants` with variant-specific operations
- Filaments router: `/filaments` for inventory management
- Queue router: `/queue` for print job management

**Authentication Middleware** [Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md]:

- Required authentication middleware using `requireAuth` pattern
- User context available in protected procedures
- JWT token validation integration needed

**Input/Output Validation** [Source: docs/architecture/trpc-api-specification-with-zod.md]:

- All procedures must use Zod schemas for input validation
- Output validation ensures type safety to client
- Search procedures include pagination and filtering options

### Component Specifications

**File Locations** [Source: docs/full-stack-architecture.md#frontend-component-organization]:

- tRPC server setup: `/app/api/trpc/[...trpc].ts` for Tanstack Start
- Client configuration: `/lib/api.ts` for tRPC client setup
- Hooks location: `/hooks/` directory for tRPC-based data hooks
- Types location: `/types/api.ts` for API-related type definitions

**Modern 2025 tRPC + Tanstack Query Integration** [Source: Latest tRPC documentation and 2025 patterns]:

- Use `@trpc/react-query@next` with enhanced createTRPCReact() for automatic hook generation
- Leverage `superjson` transformer for seamless Date/BigInt/undefined serialization
- Implement `useSuspenseQuery` and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` for better loading states
- Use tRPC-native `queryClient.utils` for invalidation patterns (utils.models.list.invalidate())
- Auto-generated typed hooks: `api.models.list.useQuery()`, `api.models.create.useMutation()`
- Enhanced optimistic updates with automatic rollback and conflict resolution
- Built-in request deduplication and intelligent caching with tRPC v11+ features

**Integration Points** [Source: docs/full-stack-architecture.md]:

- Tanstack Query v5 with latest tRPC native integration patterns
- React Aria components in `/components/ui/` for accessible interfaces
- Existing `/components/forms/` and `/components/displays/` to use auto-generated tRPC hooks

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements** [Source: PRD Technical Requirements]:

- Runtime validation exactly matches TypeScript types (1:1 mapping)
- Search operations must return results within 2 seconds
- Performance optimized validation as specified in architecture

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/full-stack-architecture.md#technology-rationale]:

- Zod + tRPC for end-to-end type safety with runtime validation
- Tanstack ecosystem for unified TypeScript experience
- 1:1 type mapping between runtime and compile-time types required

**2025 Modern Implementation Requirements**:

- Use tRPC v11+ features with enhanced Tanstack Query v5 integration
- Implement `createTRPCNext()` for optimal Tanstack Start compatibility
- Leverage auto-generated hooks instead of manual useQuery/useMutation patterns
- Use `superjson` transformer to handle complex data types (Dates, BigInts, Sets, Maps)
- Implement suspense-based data fetching with `useSuspenseQuery` for better UX
- Use tRPC's native cache invalidation with `utils.invalidate()` patterns
- Configure tRPC with streaming support for real-time updates where applicable

**Error Handling** [Source: PRD Technical Requirements]:

- Consistent error handling across all procedures
- Proper error messages for client-side display
- Development server must serve tRPC endpoints correctly

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: Architecture Requirements]:

- Unit tests required for all tRPC procedures
- Integration tests for authentication middleware
- End-to-end type safety validation testing
- Client-server communication testing with mock data

**Test File Locations**:

- No specific testing architecture found in available documents
- Recommend following existing project patterns if any test files exist
- Create test files adjacent to implementation files following standard conventions

**Testing Frameworks**:

- No specific testing framework guidance found in architecture docs
- Recommend using Jest/Vitest for unit testing tRPC procedures
- Consider MSW for mocking API calls during client-side testing
