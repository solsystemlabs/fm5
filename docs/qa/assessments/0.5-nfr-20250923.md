# NFR Assessment: 0.5

Date: 2025-09-23
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting, authentication provider not yet configured
- Performance: CONCERNS - Performance requirements defined but not implemented
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling defined but authentication robustness not implemented
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage framework ready but authentication tests not implemented

## Critical Issues

1. **Authentication Provider Not Configured** (Security)
   - Risk: No actual authentication protection yet implemented
   - Fix: Complete Tasks 1-2 to configure Clerk/Auth0 and integrate with JWT middleware

2. **Missing Rate Limiting** (Security)
   - Risk: Brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
   - Fix: Implement rate limiting middleware for auth endpoints (mentioned in story notes)

3. **Performance Monitoring Gap** (Performance)
   - Risk: No validation that authentication meets performance requirements
   - Fix: Add performance monitoring for auth checks and JWT validation

4. **Test Coverage for Authentication** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Authentication flows untested despite being security-critical
   - Fix: Complete Task 6 unit and integration tests for auth middleware

## Quick Wins

- Configure authentication provider: Story Task 1 (~4 hours)
- Add rate limiting middleware: ~2 hours
- Implement performance monitoring for auth: ~2 hours
- Create auth middleware unit tests: Story Task 6 (~3 hours)

## Assessment Details

### Security Assessment
- **Target**: JWT tokens, Row Level Security, secure session management
- **Evidence**: Infrastructure defined, RLS policies mentioned, JWT validation structure exists
- **Status**: CONCERNS - Framework ready but not implemented
- **Gaps**: No actual authentication provider, missing rate limiting

### Performance Assessment
- **Target**: "Authentication checks must not add significant latency to API calls"
- **Evidence**: Redis session storage configured, optimized user context resolution mentioned
- **Status**: CONCERNS - Requirements defined but not validated
- **Gaps**: No performance benchmarks or monitoring

### Reliability Assessment
- **Target**: Secure session management, proper JWT handling, error handling
- **Evidence**: Error handling structure in tRPC middleware, session management with Redis
- **Status**: CONCERNS - Structure exists but authentication robustness not implemented
- **Gaps**: Authentication failure scenarios not tested

### Maintainability Assessment
- **Target**: Test coverage for authentication flows, clear component structure
- **Evidence**: Test framework ready, clear component architecture defined
- **Status**: CONCERNS - Framework ready but auth-specific tests not implemented
- **Gaps**: Missing unit/integration tests for authentication middleware and flows
