# Overall UX Goals & Principles

## Target User Personas

**Primary User: Small Business Owner/Operator**

- Operates 1-3 3D printers with 2+ designer partnerships
- Produces variants (colors, sizes) from base models for keychains, earrings, decorative items
- Sells through market events, wholesale, potential consignment
- Values operational efficiency to focus on creative product development
- Comfortable with 3D printing technology but frustrated with manual workflows
- Works solo and prefers streamlined, intuitive interfaces

**Secondary User: Future Scaling Scenarios**

- May eventually hire part-time help or expand operations
- Needs systems that can accommodate basic delegation without complexity
- Values data-driven insights for business growth decisions

## Usability Goals

- **Immediate Clarity**: User can assess business status (queue, inventory, alerts) within 10 seconds of loading dashboard
- **Efficient Workflows**: Core tasks (find model, queue print, check inventory) require maximum 3 clicks
- **Visual Discovery**: Finding specific model variants is intuitive through thumbnails and search
- **Mobile Productivity**: Essential functions (status updates, inventory checks) work seamlessly on mobile during printing
- **Learning Curve**: New users can complete basic workflows within 15 minutes of first use
- **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for critical actions (deletion, batch operations)

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication and obvious functionality over aesthetic innovation
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential information first, advanced features accessible but not prominent
3. **Visual Hierarchy Through Space** - Use typography scale and whitespace, not color, to create emphasis
4. **Workflow-Centric Design** - Interface adapts to common task sequences rather than feature-oriented navigation
5. **Professional Minimalism** - Clean, spacious design that inspires confidence for business operations
