# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate file management chaos by providing systematic digital asset organization with searchable metadata
- Automate filament inventory tracking and consumption calculations to prevent stockouts and enable data-driven purchasing
- Enable intelligent production planning through smart print queue management and sales velocity insights
- Create operational efficiency that frees up 60% of admin time for R&D and market expansion activities
- Support business growth through seasonal inventory planning and market event preparation tools
- Establish foundation for future AI-powered slicer optimization and predictive analytics

## Background Context

The 3D printing business landscape for small-scale operators suffers from operational inefficiencies that limit growth potential. Current workflows rely on manual file management through Windows folders, leading to lost slicer settings, constant re-work, and inability to track inventory or production metrics. This creates a ceiling on business growth and prevents operators from focusing on creative product development and market expansion.

Our target user operates a small 3D printing business with designer partnerships, producing model variants for market events and wholesale distribution. The core problem is systematic: without proper digital asset management and inventory tracking, the business cannot scale beyond manual capacity limits. This PRD addresses these operational bottlenecks through comprehensive automation and intelligence layers.
