# Sprint Change Proposal: Epic 0.7 CI/CD Workflow Architecture Clarification

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Scrum Master:** Bob
**Epic:** 0.7 - CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Infrastructure
**Change Type:** Clarification / Enhancement
**Impact Level:** Low (Pre-Implementation)
**Status:** Approved

---

## Executive Summary

During implementation planning for Story 0.7, the CI/CD workflow architecture was identified as oversimplified. The current documentation describes a single monolithic workflow, but industry best practices and implementation requirements call for:

1. **Multiple separate workflows** (PR checks, staging deployment, production deployment)
2. **Parallelized quality checks** (linting, type-checking, Prettier, tests)
3. **Clear separation of concerns** for better maintainability and performance

This proposal clarifies the workflow architecture in Story 0.7 and the architecture document to follow industry best practices without changing project scope, timeline, or MVP goals.

---

## Analysis Summary

### Issue Identification

- **Trigger:** Implementation planning review for Story 0.7
- **Problem:** Single workflow structure doesn't reflect industry best practices or implementation needs
- **Discovery:** Proactive identification during planning (ideal timing)

### Impact Assessment

- **Epic Impact:** Story 0.7 requires clarification updates only
- **Timeline Impact:** None (pre-implementation catch)
- **MVP Impact:** None (scope unchanged)
- **Artifact Impact:** Story 0.7 and Architecture Document require updates

### Recommended Path

**Direct Adjustment** - Update documentation to reflect multi-workflow architecture with parallelization following industry best practices.

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflow** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checking
2. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests
3. **Build**: Tanstack Start production build with Nitro output
4. **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Deploy Staging**: Automatic Wrangler deployment to staging
6. **Deploy Production**: Manual approval and deployment to production

**Workflow File Structure:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

on:
  push:
    branches: [master] # Auto-deploy to staging
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual production deployment

jobs:
  test-and-build: # Quality gates
  deploy-staging: # Automatic staging deployment
  deploy-production: # Manual production deployment
```

**Change To:**

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**GitHub Actions Workflows** [Source: docs/architecture/deployment-infrastructure.md]:

**Multiple Workflow Strategy:**

FM5 uses three separate workflows following industry best practices:

1. **PR Checks Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`) - Runs on all pull requests
   - Parallelized quality checks: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, tests
   - Fast feedback loop for developers
   - Blocks merge if checks fail

2. **Staging Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) - Runs on master merge
   - Builds production bundle
   - Deploys to Cloudflare Workers staging environment
   - Runs integration tests against staging

3. **Production Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`) - Manual trigger
   - Requires manual approval
   - Deploys to Cloudflare Workers production environment
   - Includes rollback procedures

**Workflow Architecture Benefits:**

- **Parallelization**: Quality checks run simultaneously for faster feedback
- **Separation of Concerns**: PR validation separate from deployment
- **Performance**: Faster CI/CD cycle through parallel execution
- **Clarity**: Each workflow has single, clear responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual workflows

**Workflow File Structure:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: PR Quality Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [ESLint checks]

  typecheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [TypeScript checking]

  format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Prettier validation]

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Unit and integration tests]

# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [Build, deploy to staging, integration tests]

# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps: [Build, deploy to production, smoke tests]
